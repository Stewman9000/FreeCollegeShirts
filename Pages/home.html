		<h1>The Adventure of a Lifetime</h1>
		<h2>Stewart Thompson</h2>
    <p>I have 302 <em><strong>free</strong></em> college t-shirts.</p>
    <p>It was the summer f my freshman year--the peak of possibility--and I was bored to death. There was nothing to do and so I took to the internet to solve my boredom. Hours later after surfing the web, I chanced upon a story about a guy who had emailed every college in the United States and asked for a free t-shirt. He had received hundreds. Impressed, I resolved to do the same and cure my summer blues.</p>
